# CS300---Data-Structures-and-Algorithms---C-
Final Project Algorithmic Analysis and C++ Execution

The purpose of this project was to create a program for the Computer Science department of ABC University that would assist academic advisors searching for information that would help guide students throughout their course of study.

Approaching the problem required the understanding of how data structures offer dfferent tradeoffs of pros and cons and they way they are organized, and which are better suited to different tasks in order to properly decide on appropriate data structures for the task at hand, and consequently which algorithms are most effective for that structure. Beginning with such an understanding, pseudocode for the data the ABCU CS department would need manipulated was paramount for tackling the problem in a C++ implementation later.

This project has shown how diving deep into the nuanced differences between aspects of data structures, and the algorithms that work with them in tandem, are key to knowing where to go with your problems. It is better to begin with a design phase, in which you understand the general "shape" of your data and of your problem, then weigh out the best data structure that will fit that shape, and plan from there. If you frontload the design, the implementation of the code is rather straightforward. 

Additionally, this project, through the aforementioned aspects, has elevated the way I approach programs, as well as keeping them modular, functional, and easily updated.
